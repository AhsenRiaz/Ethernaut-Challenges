# Task: Forcefull Increase Balance

If a contract does not contain any method to accept ether we can still send ether to it forcefully using selfdestruct keywork. It would remove the contract from the blockchain .Invoking selfdestruct cost eth. So when we use selfdestruct it will use the required amount of eth and the rest is sent to the contract being destructed.
